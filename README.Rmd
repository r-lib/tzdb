tzdb is a developer focused R package with two purposes:

- It ships an up-to-date copy of the IANA time zone database files.

- It provides low-level access to the C++ library, [date](https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date).

To use the C++ API supplied by tzdb:

- Add tzdb to both Imports and LinkingTo.

- Call `tzdb::tzdb_initialize()` from your `.onLoad()`.

- Access the date API through `#include <tzdb/*.h>` where `*` is replaced with the date header you want to use.

Note that while `tzdb/tz.h` declares many functions and types, most of their implementations are not present in the header file. This means that the functions in `tzdb/tz.h` are _not_ safe to call from your R package. Instead, the most critical helpers have been exposed in a safe way in `tzdb/tzdb.h`. Use these instead.

## Installation

You can install the released version of tzdb from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("tzdb")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("r-lib/tzdb")
```

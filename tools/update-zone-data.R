# Notes about this updater:
#
# Don't forget to update the version below.
#
# This updater will download all the required information and will place it
# in the right place. The next few paragraphs describe what it downloads in
# case you have to do it manually for some reason.
#
# The time zone database is downloaded from: https://www.iana.org/time-zones.
# If you are going to do it manually for some reason, choose the latest
# version, and grab the one with JUST the data, in the format like
# `tzdata2019c.tar.gz`. Uncompress it, and then take the contents of the
# folder and move them into `inst/tzdata/`.
#
# On Windows, we also need a `windowsZone.xml` mapping file.
# It can be found here if you need to download it manually:
# https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unicode-org/cldr/main/common/supplemental/windowsZones.xml.
# Download this file and place it in `inst/tzdata` as `windowsZones.xml`.
# This file is only updated by CLDR ~2 times a year, so it won't always match
# the `version`, but that is typically fine.

# Update the version!
